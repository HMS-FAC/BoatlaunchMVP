Notes: - There are two Public Slipways opposite each other here on a short narrow spur of the Broad! Both owned by the Parish council, with access directly onto Hickling Broad and paddles downstream to Horsey, Martham, Somerton and Potter Heigham. You have to unhitch boat trailer and use the staithe`s winch to launch and recover. An old guy from parish comes up on a quad bike to collect £4 fee from non-parishioners and helps sometimes with winch, and if you get to know him you can put money on his boat. Can be a bit tight for space to launch and recover with boats moored opposite slipway.
