###MVP for Boatlaunch App

This is a repository for the boatlaunch app Minimum Viable Product MVP. Boatlaunch is a company which provides information about slipways and marinas in the UK and Europe. There is currently a boatlaunch website at boatlaunch.co.uk, and there is an app which was built in 2012. Boat launch has an database of around 4000 slipways, each with varying degrees of information. The database (which is stored by firebase) is updated by the users. No authorisation is required to use the website or edit the database. 

This MVP will be created in a 2 week sprint starting on the 7th December 2016. Here we have laid out the features which will be incorporated in the app and the order of their priority. 

Minimum features for the MVP
- Landing page  with map of UK featuring cluster pins on it with all the entries from the database
- Full database must be searchable by keyword
- Map must have up to date information from database 

Additional features (dependent on finishing above):
- Convert to native app using phonegap
- Upload photos – or at least be able to take photos at the site and have a way of easily uploading them when next at a computer. 
- Navigation tools
- Additional search filters
- Links to useful resources like tide, surf and weather?
- Different markers to represent different types of slipway
- ‘Flagging feature' for unavailable slipway

This project will be managed using github issues. 

TDD (Test Driven Development) will be used to guide all stages of the project.
